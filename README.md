# Calendar CLI

This was original meant to be used as a naive Ruby implementation of the [`cal`](https://www.unix.com/man-page/bsd/1/cal/) program.

## Development

So far it only builds months for any given date so there are still plenty of options missing.

- To install the dependencies run `bundle install`.

- To run the tests run `bundle exec rspec`.
